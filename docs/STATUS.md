# Project Status

**The single source of truth for where ART actually is.**

Every other document describes intent (the spec, `roadmap.md`) or mechanics
(`architecture.md`, `CLAUDE.md`). This one describes reality. When they
disagree, this file wins — and if this file disagrees with the code, fix this
file.

Update it at the end of any session that changes what works.

## Stage plan

This supersedes the phase numbering in `roadmap.md` for scheduling purposes.
`roadmap.md` still defines *what each phase contains*; this defines *what order
the remaining work happens in and why*.

### ✅ Stage 1 — Data safety (complete, 2026-08-09)

Made it impossible for ART to quietly destroy user data.

- `core/safety`: atomic writes, generational backups
- ADF mutation pipeline: `read → mutate → validate → backup → commit`
- Bounds-checked block access (a bad block number no longer aborts the app)
- AmigaDOS hash compatibility fix
- FF.CFG / PiStorm config round-trip (hand-tuned settings survive)

Defects fixed: [ART-001 … ART-020](ISSUES.md#fixed).

### ✅ Stage 2 — Workflow Engine (complete, 2026-08-09)

Made the spec's central interaction real: *drop something → what can I do?*

- `core/workflow/builtin.rs`: 22 registered workflows across ADF/LHA/HDF/ROM/folder
- `Navigate` vs `Execute` split; `run_workflow` command refuses non-read-only actions
- Dashboard renders the engine's plan instead of hard-coded buttons

### ✅ Stage 3 — Systematic audit (complete, 2026-08-09)

Audited every module with working logic. HDF/RDB held the worst of it: nine
defects ([ART-021 … ART-029](ISSUES.md#fixed)), including three critical ones.

- Hard disk images are now created **sparsely** — a 4 GB HDF no longer needs
  4 GB of RAM, and `open_hdf` reads a header window instead of the whole file
- Creating an image never replaces an existing one (HDF and ADF alike)
- RDSK logical-drive fields written at their documented offsets, verified
  against `amitools` — disks ART creates now describe their real capacity
- Partition layouts that do not fit are refused instead of silently truncated
- Folder scans are depth-limited and do not follow symlinks

`core/analysis.rs` and `core/profile.rs` were reviewed and found sound. The
remaining modules are stubs — building them is feature work, not audit work.

### ✅ Stage 4 — Shared infrastructure (complete, 2026-08-09)

Not polish — these were hard prerequisites for Stage 5, which both addenda name
directly.

| Item | Spec | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| Operation Log + error IDs | §53, §68 | AI plan audit trail, `origin: ai-plan` (§45.5.8) |
| Job Queue (background work, responsive UI) | §54, §55 | Aminet download/install queue (§41.5.6) |
| Beginner / Power User mode | §47, §48 | Aminet mirror & cache UI (§41.5.6) |

**Operation Log** — `core/oplog` records every operation that touched user data:
what was done, where the backup went, whether verification passed, and on
failure the error ID. Append-only JSON Lines, readable in Settings and
exportable as text. `OperationOrigin::AiPlan` is already in the model so the AI
layer has somewhere to declare itself from day one. Errors carry stable `ART-*`
identifiers (§68).

**Job Queue** — `core/jobs` gives platform-independent operations a
`ProgressSink` to report through and a cancel flag to check; `commands/jobs.rs`
runs them on background threads and forwards progress as throttled
`job-progress` events. Collection scanning and LHA extraction are jobs now, with
a global `JobBar` in the app shell so work started in one studio stays visible
and stoppable from anywhere. Cancellation is checked only between whole units of
work, so stopping never leaves a half-written file.

**Beginner / Power User mode** — `usePowerMode()` drives what the UI shows. In
Beginner mode the raw-data studios (Hex Tools, PiStorm), the Advanced action
group and block-level numbers are hidden; nothing is disabled, and Settings
explains what the switch changes.

### ✅ Stage W — Writing into volumes (complete, 2026-08-09)

The commander became a real file manager. `core/volume/write/` writes OFS, FFS
and INTL at any geometry — multi-block bitmaps through `bm_pages[25]` and the
extension chain, OFS data-block headers, extension chains for files past 72
blocks, hash insert/remove/rename per volume.

The decision the stage turns on: **a 2 GB image is not a big floppy.** An image
of 16 MiB or less keeps the audited whole-file pipeline exactly as it was;
anything larger is written in place under an undo journal
(`core/volume/journal.rs`) that saves every block before touching it and is
fsynced before the first image write. `Journalled::write_block` refuses any
block it has not saved, which turns "remember to journal first" from a rule
into a compile-time-shaped one. A journal found at mount blocks every write
until the user decides, and rolling it back restores the image byte for byte —
proved by a test that really kills the process at three points mid-write.

Also landed: `.uaem` sidecars in WinUAE's format so protection bits and
comments survive a trip through a filesystem that cannot hold them; F3–F9 on
the keyboard and on a bar; checkout/checkin gated on SHA-256 so an editor that
opens and closes a file cannot cause a write; `.info` pairing on rename and
delete; and a pre-flight copy plan that reports blocks, name problems and
collisions before anything is written.

The oracle now runs **both ways**: ART writes and amitools reads, amitools
writes and ART reads. Both halves are needed — a reader and a writer that agree
with each other and with nothing else is exactly what ART-032 … ART-035 were.

Still deliberately read-only: dircache volumes (a directory is stored twice),
long-filename volumes, PFS3 and SFS, and any volume whose bitmap is marked
invalid. Each is listed by name with the reason, never hidden.

### ✅ §82 — One-click WHDLoad install (complete, 2026-08-09)

The spec's first MVP success scenario, end to end:

```text
Game.lha → DROP → WHDLoad detected → Install to HDF → Backup → Apply → Verify
```

Every arrow but one already existed. The missing piece was working out **what
inside the archive is the game**: a WHDLoad archive wraps the pack in a drawer
and puts the drawer's `.info` *beside* it, not inside. Copy only the drawer and
the icon is left behind — the game is then on the disk and **invisible on
Workbench**, which is indistinguishable from a failed install.

`core/whdload` is that analysis, and it is pure: it takes a list of names and
returns where the pack is, what it is called, which file is the slave, where
the icon is, and what in the archive is not part of the game (usually a
readme, left behind and said so).

The install refuses rather than guesses. Each refusal is a case where going
ahead produces something that looks installed and does not work:

| Refusal | Why |
|---|---|
| Low or unknown WHDLoad confidence | §14/§34: an uncertain detection is never acted on as fact |
| The archive holds an `Install` script | The game is not installed yet, and running the script needs an Amiga |
| A drawer of that name is already there | Writing a game over one that is already there is not a one-click decision |
| It does not fit | With the real block numbers, before the disk is touched |
| Names AmigaDOS cannot store | A slave looks for its files by name; renaming them gives a game that starts and finds nothing |
| The archive did not unpack completely | Half a game is not a game |

Backup, journalling and per-file verification all come from Stage W — the whole
install runs in **one** volume session, so a floppy-sized image is backed up
once rather than three times.

### ⏳ Stage 5 — Spec addenda (next)

From `ART-SPEC-ADDENDA-COMPLETE.md` in the project root. **Stage 4 has landed, so
both are now unblocked** — every prerequisite they name by hand exists:

| Addendum requires | Provided by |
|---|---|
| §41.5.6 download/install queue on the standard Job Queue | `core/jobs`, `commands/jobs.rs` |
| §41.5.6 Beginner hides mirrors/cache, Power exposes them | `lib/uxmode.ts` |
| §41.5.6 per-package actions follow §46 | workflow catalogue |
| §45.5.8 operation log entry with `origin: ai-plan` | `core/oplog`, `OperationOrigin::AiPlan` |
| §45.5.1 plans made of existing, tested workflows | `core/workflow/builtin.rs` |

- **§41.5 Software Sources Engine (Aminet)** — Stage A: catalog sync, search,
  download, readme, Collection. Stage B: one-click install to HDF, update view.
- **§45.5 AI Workflow Layer** — Stage A: read-only assistant. Stage B: plan
  generation with Plan Cards. Stage C: full multi-step scenarios.

**Both are now designed, neither is built.** The designs are:

- [design-software-sources.md](design-software-sources.md)
- [design-ai-layer.md](design-ai-layer.md)

Design decisions worth carrying forward, because they are not obvious from the
addenda:

- Aminet's local catalog is a **core trait (`CatalogStore`) with a file-backed
  implementation outside core**, not SQLite. The spec says SQLite; SQLite in
  `core/` would break the independence rule and putting it in `art.db` would put
  engine logic in React. A `SqliteCatalogStore` can replace it later without
  touching `core/`.
- Network access is a core trait (`MirrorClient`) implemented outside core with
  **`ureq`** — blocking, so it fits the existing job threads and drags in no
  async runtime. Both traits get in-memory test doubles, so CI never opens a
  socket.
- The AI layer's `DangerClass` is **derived from the existing `Safety` enum** by
  a total mapping, not defined as a second parallel enum. `Experimental`
  workflows are excluded from the tool whitelist in v1.
- Secrets can only reach a plan as `@form.*` placeholders. A literal supplied
  for a `Secret` parameter is a validator *rejection*, not something ART
  sanitises.

Build order: Aminet Stage A first — it is self-contained, fully offline-testable,
and it leaves the AI layer more engine to describe when its turn comes.

#### Aminet Stage A — where it stands

`core/sources` is built and tested (115 tests, all driven by an in-memory
mirror, no socket opened):

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| `index.rs` | `INDEX` parsing, structural rather than fixed-column; malformed lines counted, never guessed |
| `readme.rs` | readme field extraction, bounded and sanitised |
| `text.rs` | the bounding/control-character rules every repository string goes through |
| `catalog/` | `CatalogStore` trait, search and ranking, version resolution, `MemoryCatalogStore` + `JsonlCatalogStore` |
| `mirror.rs` | `Mirror` URL construction, `MirrorClient` trait, failover |
| `cache.rs` | content-addressed cache layout |
| `fetch.rs` | the §41.5.3 trust pipeline |
| `sync.rs` | `sync_catalog`, including the refusal to replace a good catalog with a bad parse |

Two new error IDs, stable from here: `ART-MIRROR-UNREACHABLE`,
`ART-INTEGRITY-MISMATCH`.

Verified against live Aminet mirrors on 2026-08-09, which **corrected the
format**: the index is five columns (name · directory · size · age ·
description) with a `|` header, not the path-first layout the design assumed.
The parser was rewritten and now reads 3 026 of 3 026 data lines from a real
256 KB `INDEX` sample with zero skips. Shipped defaults —
`https://aminet.net/`, `https://se.aminet.net/`, `https://ftp.fau.de/aminet/`,
index path `INDEX` — all served a byte-identical 7 229 355-byte index and
honoured range requests.

The whole stack is built: `core/sources`, `net/http_mirror.rs` (a `ureq`-backed
`MirrorClient` that follows only same-host redirects, refuses an HTTPS→HTTP
downgrade, never reports a `200` as a resume, and rejects a body shorter than an
announced `Content-Length`), `commands/sources.rs` on the Job Queue,
`src/lib/sources.ts`, and Aminet Studio at `/aminet` in the sidebar. Transport
tests run against a real socket on localhost, so CI stays offline.

Running the finished engine against real mirrors found two defects the fixture
suite could not — [ART-030](ISSUES.md#software-sources-aminet-415) (failover
concatenated a dead mirror's bytes onto the next one's) and
[ART-031](ISSUES.md#software-sources-aminet-415) (LHA level 2/3 headers could
not be opened at all, which also broke LHA Studio for typical Aminet
downloads). Both are fixed with regression tests.

Live end-to-end, after the fixes: 7 229 355 bytes of index, 85 435 packages,
zero skipped lines, and a real AmiSSL release fetched, size-checked, hashed,
validated and cached.

**Not done in Stage A**, listed so it is not mistaken for finished:
"Add to Collection" (§41.5.6's secondary action — downloads reach the cache and
stop there), editing the mirror list from the UI (`sources_set_mirrors` exists
and is tested; the UI only displays the order), and **actually launching the
app** — everything is covered by tests and both bundles build, but nobody has
clicked the button yet.

There is deliberately no workflow-catalogue entry: nothing you can drop leads to
Aminet in Stage A, so a `route::AMINET` no workflow points at would be dead code.
Stage B's update view is the first thing that plausibly needs one.

## Phase completion criteria

Carried over from `roadmap.md`; a stage is not done until all of these hold.

- Build: PASS
- Tests: PASS
- No critical errors
- No obvious data-loss risk
- UI remains responsive
- Documentation updated (this file, [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md), [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md))
- CHANGELOG updated

---

## Picking up next session

1. Run the verification block above and confirm the snapshot still holds.
   The oracle is part of it: it is the only check that can catch ART's reader
   and writer being wrong in the same way.
2. Read this file, then [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md#open) — `ART-043` is open (the
   whole-file strategy ignores a partition's offset), and a new defect starts
   at `ART-044`. `ART-037` … `ART-040` are reserved for this phase's docs pass.
3. **Stage R and Stage W are both done.** Aminet Stage A is complete too,
   including the update view and install to HDF.
4. The named work left in the briefs:
   - **§45.5 AI Workflow Layer.** Designed
     ([design-ai-layer.md](design-ai-layer.md)), not built. Its prerequisites
     (operation log with `origin: ai-plan`, a tested workflow catalogue) are
     all in place.
   - **Dircache write support**, if it is wanted. Deliberately refused today;
     doing it properly means maintaining the cache blocks in the same
     journalled operation as the directory, which is real work rather than a
     flag.

Things deliberately left undone, so they are not mistaken for oversights:

- **No preview step** before destructive operations (§92) *except* copying into
  a volume, which now plans first and shows the cost, the name problems and the
  collisions before writing anything. Delete and overwrite still tell the user
  what happened rather than what is about to.
- **`pnpm tauri build`** succeeds; MSI and NSIS bundles were produced on
  2026-08-09. The bundles have not been installed and run from a clean machine.
- **i18n** is English-only, and only Settings, Dashboard and the page headings
  go through `t()`. The other twelve studios are hard-coded English throughout.
  Worth doing as one pass over every page rather than screen by screen — a
  half-translated app reads worse than an untranslated one.
- `docs/roadmap.md` phase marks remain the original Phase 0 plan by design —
  this file is the live position.
